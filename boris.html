    <h1>Boris Johnson will ask for Brexit delay after losing parliament vote, says EU official</h1>
    <h2 style="font-style:italic">UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson appeared to acknowledge in a letter 
        sent later to lawmakers that he would ask for a Brexit extension- as called by for an earlier law passed by his opponents.</h2>

    <p>UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will send a letter on Saturday requesting a further extension to Britain's
        departure from the European Union, an EU official said, with Johnson obliged to ask for a delay after losing a
        vote in parliament.</p>
    <p>Boris Johnson had hoped that Saturday would see recalcitrant lawmakers support the divorce deal he agreed with EU
        leaders this week and finally end three years of political deadlock since the 2016 referendum vote to leave the
        bloc.</p>
    <p>Instead, lawmakers voted 322 to 306 in favour of an amendment that turned Boris Johnson's planned finale on its
        head by leaving the prime minister exposed to a humiliating obligation to ask the EU for a delay until the end
        of January 2020, and increasing the opportunity for opponents to frustrate Brexit.</p>
    
    <p>Boris Johnson has been promising that he will take the country out of the bloc on October 31, come what may, and
        after the amendment passed, he struck a defiant tone.</p>
    <p>"I will not negotiate a delay with the EU and neither does the law compel me to do so," Boris Johnson told
        parliament. "I will tell our friends and colleagues in the EU exactly what I have told everyone else in the last
        88 days that I have served as prime minister and that further delay would be bad for this country, bad for the
        European Union and bad for democracy," he said.</p>
    <p>However, Boris Johnson appeared to acknowledge in a letter sent later to lawmakers that he would ask for a Brexit
        extension- as called by for an earlier law passed by his opponents.</p>
    <p>"It is quite possible that our friends in the European Union will reject parliament's request for further delay
        (or not take a decision quickly)," Johnson wrote.</p>
    <p>European Council President Donald Tusk said that he had spoken to Boris Johnson and an EU official said that
        Johnson had confirmed in that call that the letter asking the EU for an extension would indeed be sent.</p>
    <p>"Tusk will on that basis start consulting EU leaders on how to react. This may take a few days," the official
        said.</p>
    <p>The deadline for the letter to be sent appeared to be 11 pm on Saturday: the law itself referred to 11 pm without
        saying what time zone, but the text of the letter Johnson is meant to send refers to a deadline of 11 pm GMT.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Demonstrations</strong></p>
    <p>Saturday's amendment put forward by former Conservative cabinet minister Oliver Letwin deflated Boris Johnson's
        big Brexit day just as hundreds of thousands gathered to march on parliament demanding another referendum on EU
        membership.</p>
    <p>After several hours of heated debate, senior politicians - including Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom, House of
        Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg and Labour's foreign affairs spokeswoman Diane Abbott - were escorted from
        parliament past jeering demonstrators by phalanxes of police.</p>
    <p>The European Commission said that Britain must now inform it of its next steps as soon as possible. French
        President Emmanuel Macron told Boris Johnson that a delay was in no-one's interest, an official at the French
        presidency told Reuters.</p>
    <p>Ireland believes granting an extension is preferable to Britain leaving with no deal, but there is no guarantee
        that view is shared throughout the EU, its foreign minister said.</p>
    <p>But however weary EU leaders are of the long and tortuous road to Brexit, it seems likely that the bloc will
        grant a delay.</p>
    <p><strong>Brexit delay?</strong><br>In a move designed to prevent the United Kingdom slipping out of the EU without
        a deal by design or default, Letwin's amendment delays parliament's ultimate decision on Johnson's Brexit deal
        until the very end of the process.</p>
    <p>By supporting Letwin, whom Boris Johnson had expelled from the Conservative Party, parliament exposed the prime
        minister to another law passed by his opponents that called for him to ask for a delay until Jan. 31, 2020
        unless he had a deal approved by the end of Saturday.</p>
    <p>Even if he is given an extension that he does not want by the EU, Boris Johnson could still take the country out
        of the bloc on October 31 because the law allows him to if he can get all the legislation approved by that date.
    </p>
    <p>Rees-Mogg said that the government now planned to put Boris Johnson's withdrawal deal to a debate and vote on
        Monday, but the house speaker John Bercow said that he would rule on Monday whether he would allow that.</p>
    <p>Letwin said that he hoped Johnson's deal would succeed, but he wanted "an insurance policy which prevents the UK
        from crashing out on 31 October by mistake if something goes wrong during the passage of the implementing
        legislation".</p>
    <p>Three years after the country voted 52 per cent-48 per cent to leave the European project, many Britons say that
        they are bored with the whole Brexit argument and just want the process to end.</p>
    <p>But others demonstrating on Saturday remain angry that Britain is leaving the EU and want that reversed.</p>
    <p>Hannah Barton, 56, a cider maker from Derbyshire in central England, was draped in the EU flag. "We feel that we
        are voiceless. This is a national disaster waiting to happen and it is going to destroy the economy," she said.
    </p>
    <p>Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, backed a second referendum, saying "the people should
        have the final say".</p>
    <p>Protesters outside parliament cheered as lawmakers backed Letwin's amendment.</p>
    <p><strong>'Super Saturday'</strong></p>
    <p>Brexit "Super Saturday" topped a frenetic week that saw Johnson confound his opponents by clinching a new Brexit
        deal with the EU.</p>
    <p>When it comes to a vote in a divided parliament where he has no majority, Johnson must win the support of 320
        lawmakers to pass his deal.</p>
    <p>If he wins, he will go down in history as the leader who delivered a Brexit - for good or bad - that pulls the
        United Kingdom far out of the EU's orbit. Should he fail, Johnson will face the humiliation of Brexit
        unravelling.</p>
